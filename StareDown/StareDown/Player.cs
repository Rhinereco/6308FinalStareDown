/*
    ========================== Player: Manages Player Actions & Scoring ==========================
    PURPOSE:
    This class represents a player (human or AI) in the game.
    It manages the player's hand, turn-based actions, scoring, and special card effects.

    MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES:
    1. Card Management:
       Handles drawing cards at the start of the game and during turns.
       Manages played cards, removing them from the hand.
    2. Turn Execution:
       Allows the player to choose and play a card (single, pair, or bomb).
       Ensures valid moves based on the game rules.
       Allows drawing a card if no valid move is available.
    3. Scoring System:
       Updates the player's score based on the played card's value.
       Applies suit-based scoring effects (Spades x2, Hearts +2, Diamonds -1).
       Handles special scoring effects from face cards and Jokers.
    4. AI Compatibility:
       `PlayCards()` and `ApplyCardEffects()` are marked protected so AI can use them.
       AI logic (in `AIPlayer.cs`) can override `PlayTurn()` for automated decision-making
