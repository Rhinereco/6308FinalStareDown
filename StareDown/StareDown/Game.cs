/*
    ========================== Game: Main Game Logic ==========================
    PURPOSE:
    This class controls the main game loop and player turns.
    Manages the deck, player actions, and win conditions.
    Alternates turns between the human player and the AI opponent.

    MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES:
    1. Game Setup:
       Initializes the deck and shuffles it.
       Creates player and AI instances and gives them starting cards.
    2. Game Loop:
       Alternates turns between the human player and the AI.
       Ensures valid moves and turn-based mechanics.
       Checks if a player has played all their cards (immediate win).
    3. Scoring & Win Conditions:
       Tracks player and AI scores.
       Ends the game when the deck is empty or a player has no cards.
       Determines the winner based on score or who has fewer remaining cards.
